# capstone
Capstone project for Regis University
### This capstone project is a Code4Sacramento and Sacramento Regional Center to End Honelessness collaboration.
My goal is to design an application that allows people to find services for homeless and low-income people using an interactive map.
Some of the features requested by the product owner (SRCEH):
* Allow navigation and directions from starting point to service location
* Filter results on map by type of service
* Be viewable on a mobile device

With these design choices in mind, I am creating a small web application that draws data from the Google Maps API to provide maps and directions. I am overlaying this with a collection of models representing service locations with addresses and location details. I am then displaying the map with a set of controls.

Commit 1: Project map, first draft
